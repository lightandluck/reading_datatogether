## Stewardship (August 6, 2019)

[🎬 **Recorded Call**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbJUSvO_Xvc)

### Intro
Our selections this month begin with traditional notions and practices of stewardship. We then look briefly at present-day theory and principles around data preservation. We continue with 2 different studies of modern day institutions: an ecological research science network & an university library, and look at the continuing challenges they face and how they deal with data stewardship. Finally, we finish with a selection on the problems facing open-source software and how to sustain digital infrastructure.

### **Check-in: What is the oldest memory, story, lesson, heirloom, etc. that you hold or have received from your family, parents, ancestors?**

## Questions/Themes

### 1) Define & Redefine. How do we define Stewards/Stewardship? What are the qualities we start from and agree with? What can we learn from other traditions of stewardship? How did others pick up on the idea? How have your ideas changed or evolved over time?
> Stewardship is the management of various assets 
> That don't belong to you
> ...
> Authority, Responsibility, Accountability
> ...
> Faithfulness is the minimum requirement 
> For the steward - Wright



* The antidote of 'Dominion'. Proper use & care vs. using something up. To serve rather than to control
  
> ...one gains respect for nature by *using* it judiciously. By using a plant or an animal, interacting with it, where it lives, and tying your well-being to its existence, you can be intimate with it and understand it. (xvi) - Anderson

> ...our human forbears everywhere did not just passively gather food and basketry materials but actively tended the plant and animal populations on which they relied. **There was no clear-cut distinction between hunter-gatherers** – the category into which most California Indians had been tossed – **and the more "advanced" agricultural peoples of the ancient world.** (xvii, emphasis added) - Anderson

### 2) Proper Use. With the drive towards digitalization and it's assumed reduced cost and ease-of-use, what are we losing by not interacting with data on a more visceral level? In what ways can we encourage the use of data so that people can have that sense of stewardship over their/our data?
> Developers like to point to _usefulness_ as an indicator of whether a new project gets adopted or not. - (45) Eghbal
  
* Proper use/care is a quality for stewardship
    * Ties back to Liz's sense of citizenship shared to those "we share dreams with" or to a sense of shared purpose
    * Question for group: is there something in your life that became much closer to your heart when you began to interact with it more directly (rather than revering it)?

* Knowledge commons: without continuous use, the commons shrivels and dies (network effects), the tragedy of the anti-commons

> The traditional hand written field notebook or group station log of activities creates flexibility in practice with the possibility of in-the-field category modifications or inserted margin notes. These unexpected reorganizations and notations represent science-in-the-making yet create challenges for structured data flows and present challenges to update while data collection continues (329) - LTER

> manual data taking is inherently a question of data collector and their understanding and relationship with the instrument and the ecological site in which data is collected...the "sense" for data, that ecologists acquire as collectors of their own data in the field or laboratory, plays the most important role also in their use of data collected by someone else because it helps them to understand and to assess the data (344) - LTER

> Pushing forward with automated approaches presents a potential danger of marginalizing other approaches (345) - LTER
 
### 3) Continuity & Severance. The need for institutions & a long-term perspective. If we assume continuity, as another quality of stewardship, where have we seen that continuity been severed in data stewardship? 

> The concept of California...as wilderness---erased the indigenous cultures and their histories from the land and dispossessed them of their enduring legacy of tremendous biological wealth. - (2-3) Anderson

> ...it is tremendously important for California Indians' connection to a place to have the depth of time, for them to be able to point to a particular harvesting patch, shrub, tree, living site, or sacred spot and know that many generations before them used the same plants, walked the same paths, tended the same land. - (363) Anderson

> The craft of digital preservation is anchored in the past. It builds off of the records, files, and works of those who came before us. (122) - Owens

> There is no end for digital preservation. The best one can hope for is to be one link in an unbroken chain of memory...those links to our past, those connections to facts, and the decisions we make about who's stories matter enough to constitute our collective social memory, are now more important than ever. - (130) Owens

* How do we reconcile the frequent change of digital infrastructure with need of institutions and long-term continuity for effective stewardship?

> Digital infrastructure changes frequently...Digital infrastructure not only requires frequent maintenance and upkeep to be compatible with other software components, but its usage and adoption changes frequently as well. - (40) Eghbal


### 4) Curation. We can't preserve everything, so what do we choose to steward and preserve? What should be forgotten? How do we identify areas in need of repair and maintenance?

> Hoarding is not preservation. - (7) Owens

> Accept and embrace the archival sliver. We've never saved everything. We've never saved most  things. - (9) Owens
 
> ...one of the biggest challenges to its sustainability, is that there is no organizing body to determine what gets built or used in digital infrastructure. - (42) Eghbal

* I have hesitency about things like Secure Scuttlebutt (SSB), that have no way to edit posts. I want my art to be what remains, not my growing pains. I don't want my shame and mistakes to be entertainment or reason for capital punishment (cancel culture).

* How does maintenance and repair figure into the conversation as we focus on technological innovation and new tools?

### 5) Stewarding the Stewards. Preservation is a neverending process and so requires continuous care of not just what is preserved, but the people, practices, and culture doing the preserving. What problems can we identify with how we care for the stewards? How do we approach and resolve those problems?

> Instead of finding pathways for people to make their way into well-paid careers in libraries, archives, and museums, our society has established pathways from communities to prisons that provide cheap labor and further undermines the future of a professional cultural heritage workforce. - (127) Owens
    
> cost-cutting practices leads to increased dependence on lower-cost labor, including volunteers, interns, and outsourced workers..."This puts the long-term survival of archives at risk, which challenges the archival paradigm of long-term preservation and historical importance" - (10) Abrams, et. al

> Positions are temporary...lead to frequent staff turnover; these conditions also lead archival workers to focus on short-term goals and objectives that can be completed within the terms of their contracts. As a result, we operate without the deep knowledge that comes with long-term practice, and without the institutional memory that would enable us to sustain the many relationships on which post-custodial projects depend. - (11) Abrams, et. al

> Most of us take opening a software application for granted, the way we take turning on the lights for granted. We don't think about the human capital necessary to make that happen. - (9) Eghbal

* Issues with labor practices - EDGI has relied on the same volunteer labor and  short-term contracts. If we see ourselves as helping to steward environmental data and governance, how do we reconcile those short-term labor practices vs. long-term visions & goals?

* Reputation-based motivations - developers  contribute to popular projects and do so until they get hired at some company/corporation

* Open-source projects that are large enough to require funding and maintenance, but not popular enough to get the support they need.

### 6) Continuing, Repetition. Instead of how does this conversation end today; How do we continue these conversations, how do we continue preserving, how do we continue being good stewards? 

> Through daily, firsthand observation, become intimately familiar with the needs, chararcteristics, growth, and reproduction of plants and animals being used. - (360) Anderson

> ...caring...is not solely a matter of following nuts-and-bolts prescriptions...it comes from human motivations. Motivation is fostered within the culture itself––through art, legend, kinship systems, ceremonies, and its overarching worldview. - (361) Anderson 

> Money alone will not fix a struggling infrastructure project, because open source thrives on human rather than financial resources...An effective support strategy must include multiple ways to generate time and resources besides directly financing development. It must start from the principle that the open source approach is not inherently flawed, but rather under-resourced. - (125) Eghbal


## Notes
- KN: Stewardship is a big topic. Started the readings by looking at traditional notions of stewardship. My religious background was my first exposure to stewardship. Which is why I started with this pastor. It's a good listen. He's a great speaker. Then we moved to prayers from Kelsey's tribe, from the book she shared last time. Then went into land stewardship, Tending the Wild, about native California tribes
    - **Before we talk about data stewardship, how do others define stewardship and where did they get their ideas and how did it evolve?**
- EN: Stewardship involves taking care of something so others can benefit from it. Can take notes
- B5: Steward the notes!
- KN: Because the group is small and notes take lots of brainspace, we can take notes after, using the recording. We can just talk
- B5: The word stewardship was not part of my life before data rescue. For me, steward is a librarian, archivist, knowledge of library science. 
    - Was introduced to stewardship through library science. People who had serious views on metadata, taxonomies, filing systems. To me, steward is someone...it's a profession, a professional steward
    - If it's not apparent, I really want this to fall apart fast. But want to be honest, conceive steward as someone who has intimate knowledge of library science, can steward this, notion of availability. Can keep accessible and available for a long time. That relationship is tightly coupled. Stewarding is a very serious committment. Real responsible to be a steward of an artifact
- KN: For the readings that didn't have anything to do with library science or data, how did you respond?
- B5: Have to admit, been running a company and did not do the readings. Though I love you to bits! <3
- RB: For you B5, 2 readings are applicable to your work. LTER article and Post-custodial archives paper
- B5: Have read stuff in past
- KN: No worries, glad you're here
- Mauve: Only glanced over notes myself, only had a week, also didn't have time. Next time will have more preparation
- KN: No worries, question still stands
- Mauve: Stewardship is pretty new concept. Don't have any cultural knowledge of stewardship or personal experiences. One interesting use is by Fleeky(?) from Dat community, putting together network like communes where nomads come and do something with a given focus and then go somewhere else. A stream of nomads coming and going. But there are people living there,  stewards of the land that keep it maintained. Nomads help less. Stewards are taking care of it so others can use it and helping coordinate people. That concept as a role is interesting and cool
- KB: Is that a novel or real?
- Mauve: It's real. A community they're building. Bought land and making like a "circus" commune. Making it a network for these hubs
- KB: Cool, is there a link?
- Mauve: Will ask. Not sure if it's public yet. Will ask and post in Slack
- KB: Thanks
- KN: Kelsey, anything to add?
- KB: Heard of stewardship term in 2 contexts
    - Montessori: stewarding a space. Elementary classrooms where everybody has a chore everyday, time at the end of the day for dusting computer monitors or rolling things up, put away. Space stewardship which is cool interaction and ownership over space. No cleaners are coming. This is your space and need to take care of it.
    - Land stewardship: My dad spent career in timber sales. Dual part - they are clear cutting Alaskan forests but also works for tribal entities. Job a decade ago was stewardship of island with monoculture of spruce. Spruce takes a 100 years to mature. A lot of trees you can harvest in 10 years. But not spruce. Had to create plans accounting for livelihood but also economic, spirtual, recreational pursuits of tribal owners or shareholders. How Alaska native claims settled out, in perpetuity. Had to create plans out 100 years
    - Think about stewardship, looking at climate change, **the importance of place.** Stewarding land as opposed to nomads, which is how I've land but still attached to place. That's why circus commune is interesting. **The importance of intergenerational persistance, passing of knowledge as you lose a place**
- EN: Really appreciated Kelsey's observations and reflections. Also land stewardship is how I think of it, my partner's family runs a farm for a long time. Kelsey raised issue of ownership
    - So interesting, the steward is not an owner, taking care of someone else's stuff. Reflect on the reading, pastor's comments, felt shockingly insightful. Not expecting something so straight-forward for a sermon, but helped defined stewardship in terms of ownership, responsibility, accountability, all these things that go into taking care of somebody else's stuff for them in relation to others who are potentially using it. Lots going on, great selection
- RB: Would echo lot of that. To answer original question. The section we listened to was how I traditionally conceptualized it. Taking care of somebody else's stuff. Also, something intergenerational, going back to memory thing
    - On dad's side, lots of passing things down and understanding family history when it's special. Not like that on mom's side, contrasts
    - Thinking of things my parents have that I grew up with, or have been given me. Especially last year, grandma passed, my dad and his siblings splitting that stuff. **What needs continued custodianship? Who can provide that?** Interesting perspective on it. 
    - Sense of even though the person it was meaningful for is not around, not stewarding for society, but still sense of importance. This table is important, or this chest, or whatever. Think about that a lot. Intergenerational
- KN: I liked that people touched on ownership. Talked to neighbor who is a pastor. They had a great term, it's the "antidote to dominion", instead of lording over or controlling something. Instead, taking care of, the proper care and use of things. Theme I wanted to touch on next
    - Within the Tending the Wild reading
    - > ...one gains respect for nature by *using* it judiciously. By using a plant or an animal, interacting with it, where it lives, and tying your well-being to its existence, you can be intimate with it and understand it. (xvi) - Anderson
    - that's how you take care of it. Similaring the LTER paper they talked about how scientists in the field taking notes on paper, changing things in the margins, it's more visceral and by doing so they have a better sense of the data as opposed to just numbers in a spreadsheet
    - Going along with that idea, I'm curious
        - How do we interact with data on a more visceral level?
        - **More importantly, how do we get the public, the people we're trying to reach with our technology to use data in a way that they will want to steward it?**
        - Right now, you hear about Cambridge Analytica, "they did something with my data, what is my data, I don't know what it is, I don't care, how do I make money off that data?" 
        - How do we make people want to steward data?

- Mauve: One cool thing is if they are stewarding it without thinking about it
    - SSB is amazing because everyone acts as a steward for their data and their friends
    - You don't have to think about it, it's more "I use it". It's my digital social life. Like the behind-the-scenes, making it part. More transactional phases. I am the owner. Companies gain access through stewardship
    - SSB people create and share directly data. Think that's powerful. Think it's a way forward. How to get there is a whole other thing
    - Large groups of data are bad for this sort of thing. One ginormous dataset is so harder to care for. Logistics. It's not person-to-person, families. Need higher level orgs. The data from Large Hadron Collider. Won't have people stewarding it, but it's not "people" data, so probably ok? Large data hard to steward and people steward data as function of using it
- B5: That's elegant. To build upon it, from Post-custodial
    - continuous custodianship of material objects can no longer be the focus of archival practice. Becomes necessary to shift traditionally archival labor to record creators
    - For thinking post-custodial archiving, SSB has that. To push that labor down into protocol by automating disseminating data. By virtue of viewing, you are seeding. Lovely mechanism
    - Comes with complications. Direct follow-on conversation is scale. Lot of these patterns work if we're not taking up all of users hard drives. Not violating user's expectations. Somebody's participation, becoming seeder is great but wait this thing I downloaded is putting all this data I don't care about on my computer. Shoot!
    - Think that's part of sociological relationship to data. Hardest aspect to remedy. Requires us to stop everybody, Hey! You were upset by CA (Cambridge Analytica) and somebody aggregating your information in ways you disagree with
    - Many remedies will involve convos we didn't want to have before. How do we negotiate that?
    - Shifting labor is real, moving work onto people who weren't doing work before. When thinking about stewardship of information. That's really what we're talking about, when decentralizing - pushing the burden of keeping thing available and online, turning thin clients into stewards.
    - Paul Frazee's pick think or thin client. New responsibility, hard to change rules of game now. When internet still works this way, everyone's freeloading. Treating data people are creating as labor that can be monetized
    - Feels like central pain of decentralization and feels like one of stewardship.
    - Became a steward overnight and they didn't realize it. How do we have that convo in meaningful way, seeing value in taking SSB road
- RB: Couple thoughts in line and counter
    - First immediate reaction, pushing concept of stewardship into protocol. Good from perspective of: it makes it easy to do. Worry about ways it could hide it from conscious consideration
    - Counterpoint in here is part of what's important, in equitable society, something we should be thinking about. A new point of consideration in these new technologies. Big part of what's different in distributed web stuff. Where things live is something you should be thinking about now, it only exists if it's well stewarded by multiple people. Bears real thinking about
    - To some degree, think it's critical in systems we want to work well that gets surfaced somehow
    - Can't criticize SSB, keep meaning to read up on protocol. To degree of declaring peer/friend, you're stewarding their data. Good thing, makes it a conscious decision. But if you're doing it also for the people you're around maybe it's less good
    - Counterpoint - I think concerning issue isn't so much scale, as it is scope. Part about scale is more about measurate(?) scale. Mauve's point - can't expect people to also be stewards of LHC, but institutions have same sort of needs of co-work and co-stewardship. The instituions that support that also have to support scale
    - The concerning part to pay attention to is  scope. Intentional communities where we can consciously think about what we're stewarding and who we're communicating with. 
    - The problem is Google storing 5 billion users data instead of community of 1000 or 10, but maybe it's lots of data. It's fine because it's a scope we can make meaningful

- KN: Looking at this quote right on the screen
> Pushing forward with automated approaches presents a potential danger of marginalizing other approaches - LTER

- The idea of making it invisible... I just joined SSB and the first question I asked is, "How much data is this taking up on my hard drive?"" Asked an SSB developer, how much do I add on average when I follow someone? He couldn't answer that. That's a good question
    - What I've seen is that I started at 200MB, now follow about 30 people and it's up to 1.5GB. How did I get here???
    - He showed me other clients like Patchfoo, a light-weight client. Also Manyverse, a mobile app, and I'm unsure how much it downloads. I've had to struggle with wrangling gigs on my phone, so the invisibleness scares me

- RB: Reminds me of torrenting. Tracking seeding vs downloading. Tracking ratio
- EN: Basic idea of developing systems where actual use is stewarding data. Great to hear that idea. Tending the wild reading, one of the things that struck me - stewardship is often taking care implies don't touch it, don't use it.
    - Point is, actual stewarding for future, has to be used. Particularly environments, ecosystems. California's example requires use to persist over time, to look as it did. Question of use is so important. Maybe differs from other things like grandma's table where stewardship does not involve use
    - Maybe a lot of data we can tie those things. Or some data, those two things are separate.
    - What we're wrestling around. Incentives. How do we get people invested in decentralized stewardship? Back around to quote, "tying one's well-being to resource your stewarding". Really resonated. Incentives aren't necessarily monetary. **How to incentivize to particpate in stewardship? How their well-being is involved with care of data**
    - Another point from Tending the Wild, though there are problems of transferring land stewardship to data, but in Coda author says there's the technical rules "how do you manage resource, when do you start a fire", but affecting values, beliefs, behaviors. So much comes back to cultural rules
    - In this case, different kinds of events illustrated importance of stewardship and resource in question, social structures
    - So much more to say around incentives and role of values, developing value and belief-system around data stewardship. Framing themselves as stewards

- KB: Lots of thoughts, writing them down. Want to address incentivation
    - [Inkandswitch - You own your data](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first.html)
    - Value of offline-first apps to the user. Hint to how we make this transistion to something people feel like doing
    - For example, programmers have been resistant of IDEs in cloud app environment. Prefer offile. 
    - Why? You want it local. Want ability to work offline. Want to understand whole file structure. it's faster.
    - Not unique to programmers. **Why is everyone ok with cloud native? Why not building offline-first on the whole?**
    - Inkandswitch looking at CRDTs. Recommend the post

- Mauve: Inkandswitch is awesome. "Local-first" is revolutionary. "P2P", "decentralization", "distributed" is techy. "Local-first" has more emotion in it. 
    - Work locally first, but also spread out. Not fully offline. Really like that
    - InkandSwitch - They're using Dat under-the-hood
    - But this is not enough for a lot of people, specifically the well-off. If you have great devices and connection, local-first isn't helpful. They don't benefit as much
    - Having access to internet wasn't something I had. Programming somewhere not home, had to print docs to reference them or download whole websites for offline use. Partially because I was poor teenager with no data plan
    - With wealth disparity, people on the bottom will have most use for local-first. They have least say. In the same vicinity you can still communicate with friends. There is no cloud service to pay. Not useful to those who have everything
    - We have 2 class system: producers of tech and consumers of tech. Producers are most informed. Rich tech people working on social media don't give their children phones. They know the peril because they're building it
    - Educating people why they should care or even empowering them is very hard
    - Big point of decentralization is getting rid of servers, lowering barriers to entry. Because now having to pay $5/month for tiny VM already too much because assumes: credit card, monthly income, and tech skills to muck around in server
    - Higher level building blocks that are just your device and sharing to people reduces places where need of tech expertise. Tech expertise becomes more working with your data and sharing it

- B5: Reading group that has resonated is Civics. Civic republicanism was challenging and earns a place in this convo. Rewind to Eric's comment about incentives
    - Mind goes to block chain, economics, one interpretation of incentives
    - But other side is let's do stewardship through dependency. I rely on data therefore will store
    - Third space that has emerged - civic angle. Articulating a moral duty to participate in preservation of information. Something we should call out and talk about, 3 buckets:
        - Economic
        - Interdependence - open source
        - Classic steward - church figure taking care of text, archivist maintaining a collection. They don't depend on it, but carry a lot of weight. 
    - That's harder to talk about. In efforts for post-archival universe, we're wholly in blockchain, everything on chain and life is more boring. Or completely open-source, zealously trading - straw hats for source code. Still have middle space - agree to preserve purely because it's my job, a duty to participate somehow. We need to talk about more
    - I think about IA, when Trump's tweets get pulled out. No one thought to archive until it was deleted. All these things that aren't valued today but are much valuable for somebody later.
    - This role doesn't fit in other 2 buckets. We should challenge ourselves to ask: 
        - **In trying to articulate why people should change their behavior along the way are we talking about digital citizenship? Should we be thinking more broadly about the convo? Is that too much?**
    - Food for thought! But I got nothing

- RB: Yes, great point! Slide into post-custodial piece -> common good into collective good.
    - Want the follow on about what they mean by collective goods
    - There is a whole point about what our responsibilities are there. Common goods in current economic and cultural environment are broken and unable to fulfill that. Turning to idea of collective good. **Focus on how do you choose what those things you are responsible for? What is cultural system you're in and thinking when you're making that choice? Who is or isn't actively saying this is important, who are we saving for, how do we make those decisions in equitable and just way?**
    - Common good is just in your context. If you have the ability to do that you're probably coming from a white, colonial context. So how do you determine what goes into collective area? It's a huge deal
    - Eric had me thinking about, idea of how much space with SSB, stuff is taking up on my machine. That custodialism is pushed to edges. Producers of records are also custodians. In sense of doing for community and not just for yourself.
    - Local-first is just for yourself, then go to concept in what way can that support a community?
    - Torrent trackers, shooting for 1:1 ratio. Seeding and downloading. **Thinking about the numbers, in a community context your responsibility to store others stuff is a lot more than your own.** Which is kind of a thing, right?
    - **How to provide structures to make that easy? Cultural signifiers to make that desirable? Where do local institutions fit in in offloading burden?** It's probably not feasible for everybody. Some sort of community institution that could do that
    - Like IPFS pinning service, not paid for but agreed on, pinning data so not everything is on my machine, so I can still use my computer. So light clients can exist. Supporting a community service that does do that
    - If this is important, have to support idea the more capable or affluent you are the more you have to store of others. What kind of community things can or should exist to offload burden?

- KB: Rob's articulating what I've been calling "weight of heritage"? Also need to disambiguate 2 types of stewardship
    - In the present, care in the present of a thing. What SSB does. The way it is initially disseminated to a community
    - Other, more difficult, is long-term care of a thing. Which involves either aggregating infinite greater knowledge or pruning it. You have to. Things will get lost. At that point, questions of justice, "Who draws the line, why, for whom?" 
    - Interesting, like Facebook. We don't like how they handle our privacy or monetize. OTOH, you weren't planning to keep what they've kept. They do a good job showing it to you and feeling the same things
    - They've created an incentive structure for themselves to be good stewards in the long sense. But bad stewards by not doing it in the way people want.
    - How do manage carry all this weight? Acquaintances, families, past places. How do we make those choices? How do we make it so that people can make those choices for themselves within the platforms and protocols we design?

- Mauve: An important part is getting rid of the choice. Should I store it or not? We have scarcity of storage. If we don't have scarcity, it's not a big decision whether to keep or not. Decision is what do I want to purge. 
    - Storage is expensive, but not that expensive. A lot of it is artificial. Phones with 32GB in 2019. By 2019 standards, that sucks. Who does that benefit? Cloud providers. There are SD cards that TBs. How much do users need? How hard is it to have external drive? In terms technology, getting rid of the choice of what do I store or not store. It's possible to make it easier
    - A lot of push for thin clients is to push cloud forward. But if you make it a little thicker, suddenly some things are a big as deal. Storage, data

- KN: Storage is cheap enough to keep everything, but I do want a choice. Back to SSB, I'm sure there was a lot of thought that went into it, once things are posted its uneditable, immutable. It stays in the record
    - When I think about any social media, I don't want everything to exist forever. Right to be forgotten
    - What do we want to steward, maintain? Don't want me 20s to be other people's entertainment. I don't wnat my mistakes to haunt me forever. I grow
    - What do we choose to keep? What do we choose to let go of?

- Mauve: Regarding deletion, big question, not talked about enough. Tried to bring up in Dat for last couple years. Not hard to do if people behave well
    - **when publishing and it replicates across the world, that's scary**
    - But if we have "unpublish", and have people who respect that
    - Tombstone - Mark something as deleted, and can't undelete
    - You don't have to replicate everything in a distributed system. Also, not everything has to be public and replicated to everybody. Facebook posts that are public are weird. Also, adding new contact and they see your entire life is weird. Encryption is something we can use that's underutilized
    - Moving to decentralization, distributed systems–only privacy now is encryption. Scary, but a question we have to think about
    - When creating data, who can see it? As app devs, we have to inform users. Available forever, for friends. Avoid people keeping copies because they're a jerk

- KN: Is it possible for self-destruct messages?
- Mauve: Cryptographically, can't make self-destruct messages. Maybe new sci-fi tech, it's a trust thing. Snapchat - people can still screenshot or take a pic. Information theory makes this a pain. Once something is out there, it's OUT THERE!

- KB: Trust changes over time too. Marriage and divorce. The person you trusted with life and things, is no longer trusted. Our system needs to account for that
- Mauve: Side channels is hard problem. Make software that behaves well. This is where centralization wins. Default mode of arbiter. 
- RB: A bunch of this is software design, a lot is about trust. None of these systems remove trust. 
    - Concern in dweb, blockchain people talk about not needing trust. This discussion shows how critical it is. More pieces and people because we're removing arbiter like Facebook. As long as you trust arbiter, then they can lock other person out
- B5: Important to not ask our technology to do things it can't do. I can't unsay things, no takebacks in experiential world. When you send an email, it's public. Someone can disseminate it on forward
    - We try to build protocols to automate away worst aspects of society
    - Back to stewardship - how stewardship is dynamic and part of the awesome responsiblility is the discretion of the author, authorial intent, the desire to have a commonly agreed system where rules are understood before stewardship begins
    - Embedded in this convo, is we should have a delete button, a way to transmit desire to delete. Right now, it's not in the protocol. Not a slight, it's hard to make and there's lots of other things to make and prioritize
    - As we're trying to get around how stewardship funcitons and how we move across these categories, it comes with new problems and challenges that may not come until the future and Kelsey's aspect of temporal
    - You don't want a delete button, until the minute you really need one. And you don't want a bi-directional, encrypted protocol until you do
    - Don't ask things that aren't possible. It's not possible for protocol designers to think of all edge cases. There's the whole history of law and governments, tyring to plan for stuff you can't plan for
    - Humbling and pressing need for us to break down barriers between producers and consumers, rely on accurate effort to translate into useful metaphors. That effor belongs on people who author protocols

- Mauve: Tech in distributed space don't talk about law. People ask - What if I publish copyrighted stuff on Dat? You get sued! If you're doing something illegal, you should be sued
    - Some tech people think exclusively about what's cryptographically possible or not possible, but miss the social aspect. The tech should have good defaults that reduce onboarding(?), but societal pressures should push forward
    - How do we as a society decide what's good and bad? What to do about it? How can tech not get in the way and provide good guarantees
    - Focusing on just the tech is not enough. It's the least interesting part. Though most to me because it's my speciality
    - On a bigger scale - cultural values, morals, stewardship we focus on. Filecoin - stewardship is in the protocol. Just publish and free market provides, no human involvement. It's one approach, but alternative is people agree on what to do and that's important
    - A partner has data that's confidential, there should be social repurcussions, but tech should try to protect. But then, ditch math and go for the club!

- KB: Loved where we started with personal artifacts moving forward. Loved moved through also: what we're keeping, why we're keeping, who we're keeping it for
    - Close with quote from short story, talks about disappearance of data over time - The Witness
> But something or an infinite number of things dies in every death unless the universe is possessed of a memory as the Theosophists(?) have supposed. In the course of time, there was a day that closed the last eyes to see Christ, the bottle of jounin(?), and the love of Helen each died with the death of some one man. What will die with me when I die? What pitiful or perishable form will the world lose? The voice of Macedonia Fernandez? The image of a roan horse upon the vacant lot of Cerrano and sharkas(?)? A bar of sulfur in the drawer of a mahogany desk

- Stewardship and remembering tech can not solve every problem. There will be losses: experiential, deeply personal, the way the data affected you or made you feel. Cool to hear everybody talking about different ways data is impacting them. Ways in which we think about what goes forward or deleted. Maybe nothing is deleted? Finding value and remembering that not everything gets saved, so the work of trying to save what we can is all that we can do in some sense

- KN: Thanks Kelsey, great way to not end the conversation but leave us thinking more about how to continue this? Hope people think about how do we continue this conversation? How to be good stewards? Preserving what should be preserved, what we want to preserve or letting people choose? Thanks for an awesome conversation.

- B5: Will create issue for decentralization. Especially local-first as foil for challenging decentralization
